        Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic

         translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in zucchini; cook and stir for 5

        Make 4 wells in the tomato mixture, and crack the eggs into each well.
        Do not stir. Cover and cook until eggs are desired consistency, about
        3 minutes for soft yolks. Carefully remove the eggs from the skillet
        and serve with the tomato sauce.

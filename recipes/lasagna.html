    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 pound of ground beef</li>
      <li>28 ounces of red sauce</li>
      <li>14.5 ounces of diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>1/2 an onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 clove of garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons of dried basil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons of dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of black pepper</li>
      <li>2 cups of malfada noodles</li>
      <li>1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="steps_header">Steps</h3>
    <ol class="steps_list">
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the
        hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard
        grease. Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, oregano,
        salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat until sauce is hot, about 15
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a
        rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to
        the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely
        coated. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the
        oven's broiler.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and
        bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
